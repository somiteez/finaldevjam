             <div class="para"> <p><b>The 10th Revision of International Classification of Diseases ICD-10, which is the basis for diagnosing mental disorders in the Czech Republic, classifies depression as an affective disorder (mood disorder). The disorder can have three forms: mild, moderate and severe forms of depression. One of the first symptoms is a change in mood toward the negative pole: the individual feels sad, needless, and/or unimportant. The disorder significantly affects self-confidence, which is often reflected in social relationships. It is typically accompanied by vegetative symptoms which can manifest as gastrointestinal problems (nausea, diarrhea etc.), tremors, sweating, or dry mouth. Sleep is also affected: the individual may have problems falling asleep, waking up, or staying asleep through the night. The effects of depression extend beyond the individual patient, with negative impact on patients’ employers, spouses, and children</b></p></div>

“Humans are still social animals and advertising our problems, especially ones that have historically been misunderstood, runs counter to our biology and social conditioning,” says Dr. Sinyor.

“We’re programmed to project strength to those around us.  That said, we’ve come a long way.  Decades ago we had the same issue with cancer.  People were frightened or embarrassed to talk about it, but now it’s become easier to share that diagnosis.”</p>
