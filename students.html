            <p><h2>SLEEP</h2>
              Students, with their packed schedules, are notorious for missing sleep. Unfortunately, operating in a sleep-deprived state puts you at a distinct disadvantage. You’re less productive, you may find it more difficult to learn, and you may even be a hazard behind the wheel.Don't neglect your sleep schedule. Aim to get at least 8 hours a night and take power naps when you need them.

          	<div class="l1"><h1>STRESS MANAGEMENT</h1>
          	<p>Most students experience significant amounts of stress, and this stress can take a significant toll on health, happiness, and grades. For example, a study by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that teens report stress levels similar to that of adults, meaning that they are experiencing significant levels of chronic stress, that they feel their levels of stress generally exceed their ability to cope effectively. Roughly 30% report feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or sad because of it.
Stress can affect health-related behaviors like sleep patterns, diet, and exercise as well, taking a larger toll.An NYU study found that much of high school students' stress originates from school and activities and that this chronic stress can persist into college years and lead to academic disengagement and mental health problems.</p></div>

        <p><h2>VISUALZIATION</h2>using guided imagery to reduce stress is easy and effective. Visualizations can help you calm down, detach from what’s stressing you, and turn off your body’s stress response.You can also use visualizations to prepare for presentations and score higher on tests by vividly seeing yourself performing just as you’d like to.

                <p><h2>EXCERCISE</h2>One of the healthiest ways to blow off steam is to get a regular exercise program going. Students can work exercise easily into their schedules by doing yoga in the morning, walking or biking to campus, or reviewing for tests with a friend while walking on a treadmill at the gym.Starting now and keeping a regular exercise practice throughout your lifetime can help you live longer and enjoy your life more.
