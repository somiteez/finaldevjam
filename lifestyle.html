        <p style="margin-top:40px;font-size: 22px;font-family:cursive;">A diagnosis of depression means different things to different people.To help others avoid the same mistakes, we have some  engaged people who are living with depression what they’ve learned about managing their condition, and what strategies and advice they’d like to pass along.</p>

        		<p><h1>1.Take Your Diagnosis Seriously</h1>
        		Not neglecting your condition also means complying with treatment recommendations, says Moe Gelbart, PhD, a psychologist at the Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California. “It’s quite common for patients to resist taking medication,” Dr. Gelbart says. “This could be due to side effects, like weight gain and decrease of sexual libido, or just to a sense that if they take medication, they're admitting something is wrong with them.”He advises people to accept depression as an illness, not as a sign of weakness or defect — something Harman echoes as well. Managing depression is not unlike managing any other chronic illness, such as diabetes, Harman has learned. “These are typically life-long illnesses that simply require good maintenance</p>

          	<p><h1>2. You’re Not Alone, So Seek Help and Support</h1>“You are not alone,” each person interviewed says.The reality, says  that “depression is an indiscriminate mother.” It affects all different kinds of people: “the pretty ones and the not-so-pretty ones, the quick and the slow, the rich and the poor.” Yet everyone interviewed says they battled loneliness    	</p>

       			<p><h1>3. Be Gentle and Compassionate With Yourself</h1>“I wish I had been kinder and gentler to myself and learned self-compassion, instead of beating myself up for being depressed in the first place,” says Borchard.Others echoed her words of wisdom. “Don’t be too hard on yourself when you have feelings of despair or of being overwhelmed,” Hutton says. “Believing that you’re wrong or bad can take over pretty quickly.”It helps to acknowledge that life is hard with depression or not, Harman says. “Gentleness is the only way to live through that hardness.”</p>

       		            <p><h1>4. Get Treatment — But Don’t Limit Your Treatment Options</h1>The most common regret Gelbart hears from patients is that they didn't seek help sooner.“I wish I hadn’t delayed going on medication,” Claude says. Stigma played a role in his reluctance to accept his diagnosis, but once he learned of a family history of depression and anxiety, he accepted the need to take medication.</p>

          	<p><h1>5. Educate Yourself and Become Your Own Advocate</h1>“You are your best advocate and responsible for your recovery, so arm yourself with information,” Claude says. He recommends consulting “Doctor Google,” but with a grain of salt — and always consult a medical professional before trying different strategies to manage your symptoms. “There’s no cure, and there’s no magic bullet to treat depression.

       			<p><h1>6. Invest in Healthy Lifestyle Changes</h1>
If possible, building a business or work environment that allows flexibility and downtime can help you incorporate self care into your life, Hutton says. If restructuring your life that way is not possible, making other changes usually is.“Work on things you have control over, like balancing your life in relation to work, engaging in exercise, eating better, stopping use of substances like alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs to self-medicate, reaching out to those you are close to and increasing your communication, and engaging in more pleasurable activities.f good eating habits, regular exercise, and sufficient and quality sleep aren’t currently part of your lifestyle, you’ll need to dig deep to find the motivation and energy to incorporate these elements into your recovery approach and make lifestyle changes,”</p>
