<h1><b>CAUSES</b></h1><p><b>The causes of depression are not fully understood, but scientists think that an imbalance in the brain's signaling chemicals may be responsible for the condition in many patients. However, there are several theories about what this imbalance actually is and which signaling chemicals are involved. Moreover, a variety of distressing life situations are also associated, including early childhood trauma, a job loss, the death of a loved one, financial troubles or a divorce.

Most likely, depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors, according to the NIMH. 

Certain medical conditions may also trigger depression, including an underactive thyroid gland, cancer, heart disease, prolonged pain and other significant illnesses. Hormonally induced depression can arise after childbirth or at menopause as well.Diagnosis
To diagnose a person with depression disorder, doctors may ask patients about their family health history, mood and behavior patterns (such as eating and sleeping), and thoughts of suicide. They may also ask patients to report their depression symptoms on a printed questionnaire.

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is a mental health guidebook for doctors published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose a person with major depressive disorder, the person must show five or more of the symptoms (listed above) for at least two weeks. The person must also exhibit a depressed mood, or loss of interest or pleasure.

It must also be ruled out that the symptoms are not caused by another medical condition, such as a thyroid problem, or due to the direct effects of a drug or medication. So doctors may do a blood test, or test the thyroid to make sure it's functioning properly, according to the Mayo Clinic.

And lastly, doctors look at whether "the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning," according to the DSM.</b></p>

<p><h1>When to Get Help</h1>
Depression is a common yet serious mood disorder that affects how you feel, think, and handle daily activities like working. To be diagnosed with depression, symptoms must be present for at least two weeks. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, in 2016, an estimated 16.2 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode over the past year. That number represented 6.7 percent of all U.S. adults.

Dealing with depression can be challenging, but the good news is that there are many people who can help. Some primary care doctors use mental health screening tools to identify potential mental health problems. Primary care doctors can prescribe medications for conditions like depression and anxiety. However, depending on your problem, they may refer you to another member of the mental health team for specific medications or other forms of therapy.

A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and preventing mental health and emotional problems. Psychiatrists can prescribe medication and often see people with serious mental illnesses such as major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). You usually need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a psychiatrist.

Psychologists can provide different types of psychotherapy or “talk therapy.” Licensed social workers can also provide talk therapy and are often covered by health insurance plans. Because licensed social workers are generally less expensive than clinical psychologists and trained to work with a variety of clients, they are sometimes the preferred mental health provider within health insurance plans.

The many ways to treat depression include:<ol>

<li>Increasing physical activity</li>
<li>Mind-body practices like yoga</li>
<li>Medication</li>
<li>Psychotherapy</li> </ol></p></div>
