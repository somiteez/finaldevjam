 	 		<p><b> How to Manage Depression Triggers
Rule #1: Stay in talk therapy.

Even when your depression is in remission, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Working through your potential triggers as they happen is vital to ensuring they don’t spiral further.

If you have seen the same therapist for a number of years, they’ll be keyed into your specific triggers and can help you when they surface. If things are going relatively well with your depression and you don’t have much to talk about, you can scale back to every other week instead of weekly if you need to.

 	 		<p><b><u> Anxiety and depression</u>
In Singapore, 10 percent of the population suffers from anxiety or depression, according to Singapore General Hospital.

These problems manifest as worrying too much, not enjoying life and being physically and mentally exhausted to the point of not functioning normally.

How to know if stress is the cause of your anxiety or depression? Look out for symptoms such as being unable to cope with changing circumstances, feeling overwhelmed, having a fear of being judged or a lack of belief in being good enough.

Talking to a professional about your stressors as well as working on behavioral (action) and cognitive (thinking) solutions can help turn things around. Adequate sleep is a must, as is fostering a supportive environment with friends, family and workmates.

And if the evening news is stressing you out, turn it off. You, after all, are the boss of you.</b></p>
